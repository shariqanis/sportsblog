                <p>India captain Rohit Sharma announced that he was retiring from T20 international cricket after winning the World Cup in Saturday's final against South Africa. Rohit said he would continue for India in the Test and ODI formats but was stepping back from the shortest format. Rohit's announcement came shortly after his teammate Virat Kohli also announced his retirement from T20 cricket for India.</p>
                <p>"No better time to say goodbye," Rohit said during the post-match press conference as he celebrated India's historic second T20 World Cup title. The decision marks a fitting end to Rohit's T20I career, as he began it with a World Cup win and concluded it with another. Between those 17 years, Rohit rose to unprecedented heights as a batter, finishing as India's highest run-scorer in T20Is with 4231 runs from 159 matches at an average of 32.05. His five centuries in the format is also the most by any Indian batter. He was made India's full-time T20I captain in November of 2021 and capped off a memorable career with a 50th win as skipper.</p>
