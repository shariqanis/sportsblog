The tournament was held in the United States from June 20 to July 14, 2024, and was co-organized by CONCACAF. This was the second time that the United States hosted the tournament, having hosted the Copa América Centenario in 2016. Argentina was the defending champion, and successfully won a record sixteenth title after defeating Colombia 1–0 after extra time in the final, which was played on July 14, 2024, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.</p>

                <p>The number 10 was the maestro who led Colombia to another CONMEBOL Copa América™ Final while earning a record number of assists in a single edition. James scored one goal and provided six assists, a tournament record. He was chosen as the tournament's Best Player in Colombia's runner-up campaign. Colombia should be proud of what they have accomplished throughout the CONMEBOL Copa América United States 2024™, in which they end as runners-up after an unforgettable final against Argentina. Pride, in particular, should be felt for the impressive performances of midfielder James Rodríguez, elected the Best Player of this edition with great deservedness.</p>
